Hello all,
I've been away from the simple editor for more than a month. Sean asked me to break down the simple editor into the different task.
Link to the most recent breakdown, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1izbm6ZZf4BoUrWbiVAg_xuTQnrHPJCLpb001PgplZwE/edit?usp=sharing. 
Can you review and suggest changes, also please update this tracker if you opt to work on a task.
Also kevin will be joining the simple editor team, to coordinate and paceup the development of the simple editor, can we have a meeting on saturday or sunday?

Thanks,
Himanshu
